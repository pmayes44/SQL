--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I answered a few questions with data using the following SQL.

--1) How many of the top 50 songs had a popularity over 90?

SELECT COUNT(popularity) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 90;

--2) List the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--3) List the average popularity, average danceability and average energy for each artist in the top 50 sorted by artist?

SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability), AVG(energy) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

--4) List the 10 most popular artists.

SELECT artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--5) Which artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

--Here I created a temporary table to determine all artists Avg Popularity and then created a query that named all artists over 90  popularity as 'Top Star'.

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
