--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--1) How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--2) How many of those orders were for an IPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--3) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--4) Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct Product,price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE price IN(SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

--Alterative answers depending on which RDBMS we are using--

--SELECT distinct product, price 
--FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
--ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--SELECT distinct product, MIN(price) 
--FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
--GROUP BY product, price 
--ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--SELECT product, min(price) 
--FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
--GROUP BY product, price 
--ORDER BY price ASC
--LIMIT 1;

--5) What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue, Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--6) Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

--7) How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),AVG(Quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
Where Feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--8) List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

--9) Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>2;

--10) How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity, Product FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY Product;

--11) What was the average amount spent per account in February? 

SELECT SUM(quantity*price)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS Avg_amount_spent FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Can also be answered like this

SELECT avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--12) What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 

SELECT SUM(quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS Avg_Quantity FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--13) Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?;

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity*price) AS total_revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
